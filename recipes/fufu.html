<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs of yam</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp of black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take a medium-sized pot and pour cold water into it.</li>
        <li>Peel the yams carefully, cut them into chunks, 
            and place them in the cold water</li>
        <li>Let them boil over high heat for 25 minutes
            or until they are soft.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the yams from the boiling water and 
            allow them to cool. Reserve one cup of the 
            cooking water.
        </li>
        <li>Now place the yams into a large bowl and 
            add salt, pepper, and olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>Mash all the ingredients using a food processor
            until it becomes smooth. The mixture should 
            become sticky and slightly elastic.
        </li>
        <li>Add some of the reserved water and work the dough.
            Keep working and adding water until you have a 
            springy dough that comes out from the bowl easily.
        </li>
        <li>Shape the Fufu into equal-sized balls and serve
            with your favorite soup or stew.
        </li>
    </ol>
